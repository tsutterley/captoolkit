load_constituent.py (07/2020)
Loads parameters for a given tidal constituent

Example:
    amplitude,phase,omega,alpha,species = load_constituent(c)

Input:
    c: tidal constituent ID

Output:
    amplitude: amplitude of equilibrium tide in m for tidal constituent
    phase: phase of tidal constituent
    omega: angular frequency of constituent in radians
    alpha: load love number of tidal constituent
    species: spherical harmonic dependence of quadrupole potential

Requires:
    numpy: Scientific Computing Tools For Python
        https://numpy.org
        https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html

History:
    Updated 07/2020: add more constituents from OTPSnc and function docstrings
    Updated 09/2017: Rewritten in Python
